<h2>Printing data</h2>
<p>When you write programs, you often need to print calculation results, text, or any other type of data. Also,
    throughout this course, you will write a lot of programs that print data on the screen. Let's learn
    how to do that using a standard approach in Java.
</p>

<h4>Displaying text using println() and print()</h4>
<p><strong>Standard output</strong> is a receiver to which a program can send information as text. It is supported by
    all common operating systems. Java provides a special <code>System.out</code>object to work with the standard
    output. We will often use it to print data.
</p>
<p>The <code>println</code>method displays the passed string followed by a new line on the screen
    (<strong>print-line</strong>). For example, the following code snippet prints four lines.
</p>
<pre><code>System.out.println("I ");
System.out.println("know ");
System.out.println("Java ");
System.out.println("well.");</code>
    <code>I
know
Java
well.</code>
</pre>
<p>All the strings were printed as they are, without double quotes.</p><p>This method allows you to print an empty line
    when no string is given:
</p>
<pre><code>System.out.println("Java is a popular programming language.");
System.out.println(); // prints empty line
System.out.println("It is used all over the world!");</code>
</pre>
<p>And here is the output:</p>
<pre><code>Java is a popular programming language.

It is used all over the world!</code></pre><p>The <code>print</code> method displays the value
    that was passed in and places the cursor (the position where we display a value) after it. For example, the code
    below outputs all strings in a single line.</p>
<pre><code>System.out.print("I ");
System.out.print("know ");
System.out.print("Java ");
System.out.print("well.");</code>
</pre>
<p>We receive the following output:</p>
<pre><code>I know Java well.</code></pre>
<p>Pay attention to the spaces between words. We pass them to the method for printing.</p>

<h4>Printing numbers and characters</h4>
<p>Both <code>println</code> and <code>print</code> methods allow a program to print not only strings and characters,
    but also numbers.</p>
<p>Let's print two secret codes.</p>
<pre><code>System.out.print(108);   // printing a number
System.out.print('c');   // printing a character that represents a letter
System.out.print("Q");   // printing a string
System.out.println('3'); // printing a character that represents a digit

System.out.print(22);
System.out.print('E');
System.out.print(8);
System.out.println('1');</code>
</pre>
<p>Here is our output:</p>
<pre><code>108cQ3
22E81</code>
</pre>
<p>As is the case with strings, none of the printed characters contain quotes.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>In Java, you can print data via the standard output using the <code>System.out</code> object. You can use the
    <code>println</code>method to display the passed string in a print-line and the <code>print</code> method to output
    all passed strings in a single line. Both of these methods also allow for printing numbers and characters.
