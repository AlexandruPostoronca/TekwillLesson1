<h2>IntelliJ IDEA</h2>
<p>IntelliJ IDEA is the leading Java and Kotlin IDE by JetBrains.</p>
<p>In the industry, it stands out with:</p>
<p>
    <strong>The most advanced context-aware editor</strong> that gives you code completion hints as you type, provides
    fixes for errors and warnings, and lets you find anything from classes to tool windows.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>In-depth code understanding</strong> guarantees that the IDE can instantly detect errors and provide
    relevant suggestions in every context.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Out-of-the-box experience</strong>, which means that you can start coding right from the first launch.
    Mission-critical tools and a wide variety of supported languages are at your fingertips – no plugin hassle involved.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Tools for collaborative and remote development</strong>.
</p>
<p>IntelliJ IDEA comes in two editions:</p>
<p>
    <strong>IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition</strong> is a free version containing more than enough features to cover the
    essential needs of most Java and Kotlin development.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate</strong> is a full-featured commercial version that supports various frameworks and
    technologies for backend and frontend development. It offers an advanced toolset to streamline your workflow. There
    are profiling, database tools, and an HTTP client right out of the box.

<h4>Create your first project</h4>
<p>Let's take a closer look at how the IntelliJ IDEA works. To start with, follow the steps below to create your first
    app in IntelliJ IDEA.</p>
<p>1. Install IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition on your computer and launch it.</p>
<p>2. If no project is currently open in IntelliJ IDEA, click on
    <em>New Project</em> in the
    <em>Projects</em> section on the
    <em>Welcome screen</em>. Otherwise, select
    <em>File</em> |
    <em>New</em> |
    <em>Project</em>.
</p>
<img alt="" src="1.5.5.png" width="600" style="margin: auto">

<p>3. In the
    <em>New Project</em> wizard, select
    <em>New Project</em> from the list on the left. There is also an option to create an empty project without language
    support.
</p>
<p>4. Name the project (for example,
    <em>Demo</em>) and change the default location if necessary.
</p>
<p>5. We're not going to work with version control systems in this tutorial, so leave the
    <em>Create Git repository</em> option disabled.
</p>
<p>6. Select
    <em>Java</em> in
    <em>Language</em>, and
    <em>IntelliJ</em> in
    <em>Build system</em>.
</p>
<img alt="" src="1.5.6.png" width="600" style="margin: auto">

<p>7. To develop Java applications in IntelliJ IDEA, you need the Java SDK (JDK). Your IDE will fill in the JDK field
    automatically. But you can change it, add the necessary JDK from your computer, or download one.</p>
<p>8. IntelliJ IDEA creates the project. When this process is complete, the structure of your new project is shown in
    the
    <em>Project</em> tool window. There are two top-level nodes:
</p>
<p>
    <em>Demo</em>. This node represents your project module. The
    <em>.idea </em>directory and the file
    <em>Demo.iml</em> are used to store configuration data for your project and module, respectively. The
    <em>src</em> directory is for your source code.
</p>
<p>
    <em>External Libraries</em>. This category represents all the "external" resources necessary for your development
    work. The standard files of your project language are placed there. You can also add other resources manually.
</p>
<h4>Write your first code</h4>
<p>Now we will write a simple piece of Java code for the Demo project.</p>
<p>First, let's create a class and a package.</p>
<p>1. In the
    <em>Project</em> tool window, right-click on the
    <em>src</em> directory, select
    <em>New</em> (or press
    <code>⌘N</code>), and then choose Class Java.
</p>
<img alt="" src="1.5.7.png" width="600" style="margin: auto">

<p>2. In the
    <em>Name</em> field, type
    <em>com.example.demo.Demo</em> and click on "OK". This is how you create a package. Packages are used for grouping
    together classes that belong to the same category or provide similar functionality.
</p>
<img alt="" src="1.5.8.png" width="600" style="margin: auto">

<p>Together with the file, IntelliJ IDEA has generated some content for your class. In this case, the IDE has inserted
    the package statement and the class declaration.</p>
<p>Second, let's write the
    <em>Main</em> method and call the
    <em>println()</em> method. You can start typing the symbols, and the IDE will prompt you about possible code
    variants. This feature is called
    <em>code completion</em>. With its help, IntelliJ IDEA analyzes the context and suggests the choices that are
    reachable from the current caret position.
</p>
<p>But in this tutorial, let's try another way. We will add the methods with
    <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-live-templates.html#write-code"
       rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Live Templates</a> – code snippets that you can insert into
    your code.
</p>
<p>1. Place the caret at the class declaration string after the opening bracket
    <code>{</code> and press
    <code>⇧ ⏎</code> to start a new line.
</p>
<p>2. Type
    <em>main</em> and select the template that inserts the
    <em> </em>
    <code>main()</code> method declaration.
</p>
<p><img alt="" src="1.5.9.png" width="600" style="margin: auto"></p>
<p><img alt="" src="1.5.10.png" width="600" style="margin: auto"></p>

<p>As you type, IntelliJ IDEA suggests various constructs that you can use in the current context. You can see the list
    of available live templates using
    <code>⌘J</code> (macOS) or
    <code>Tab</code> (Windows, Linux).
</p>
<p>3. To call the
    <code>println()</code> method, type sout and press
    <em>Enter</em>. Inside the parentheses, type:
    <code>"Hello, World!"</code>.
</p>

<p>Congratulations! You have written your first Java app in IntelliJ IDEA. For more information, you can always refer to
    the complete
    <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-running-your-first-java-application.html#create_project"
       rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">official tutorial</a>.
</p>
<h4>Run and debug your application</h4>
<p>When you have a ready-to-go program, you can run it. Then, it's possible to check it for possible problems with the
    help of the debugger. Let's see how these tools work.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Run</strong>:
</p>
<p>1. Click on the green triangle
    <em>Run</em> button (
    <img alt="" src="1.5.13.png" width="17" style="display: inline-block">)
    in the gutter and select
    <em>Run 'HelloWorld.main()'</em> in the popup. The IDE will start to compile your code.
</p>
<img alt="" src="1.5.14.png" width="600" style="margin: auto">

<p>2. You will see the result in the Run window that appears.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Debug:</strong>
</p>
<p>1. To test your program with the debugger, you must first set a breakpoint. Click on the gutter at the executable
    line
    of code where you want to set the breakpoint. Alternatively, place the caret at the line and press
    <code>⌘F8</code> (macOS) or
    <code>Ctrl+F8</code> (Windows, Linux).
</p>
<p>2. To run the debugger, click on the
    <em>Bug</em> button next to the
    <em>Run</em> one. The Debugger window will then appear with the result.
</p>

<h4>Customize IntelliJ IDEA</h4>
<p>There are many settings that you can configure based on what you want or need.</p>
<p>1. To configure your IDE, select
    <em> IntelliJ IDEA</em> |
    <em>Preferences</em> (macOS) or
    <em>File</em> |
    <em>Settings</em> (Windows and Linux). For example, go to
    <em>Appearance &amp; Behavior</em> |
    <em>Appearance</em> and choose different themes. In this topic, we use
    <em>Darcula</em>.
</p>
<p>2. If you want to find something specific in the settings, use the search box as shown below.</p>
