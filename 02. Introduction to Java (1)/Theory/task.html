<h2>Introduction to Java</h2>

<h4>What is Java?</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Java </strong>is a general-purpose modern programming language initially developed by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sun
        Microsystems</a>, and currently owned by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
       title="Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation">Oracle Corporation</a>. The key feature of the
    language is
    <strong>platform independence</strong>: it means that the same Java program can be run on multiple platforms without
    any changes! This principle is also known as
    <em>"write once, run anywhere"</em> (or
    <em>WORA</em>).
</p>
<p>Java has been one of the most popular programming languages for many years. It has earned the top position in the
    <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TIOBE</a> index (a
    programming language popularity index). This language is used by a huge community of developers around the world! If
    you have a problem, you can always ask other developers or find a suitable answer online.
</p>
<p>Java is used in our
    <strong>Android</strong> smartphones, the financial services industry, telecommunications, embedded systems, and in
    many other areas. Medical applications use it to store patient data, computer games, such as Minecraft, are created
    using Java; development tools like IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse wouldn't exist without it.
</p>
<h4>A short history of Java</h4>
<p>The Java language project was initiated in 1991 by James Gosling and his colleagues. In the beginning, the language
    was called "Oak." Later the project was renamed "Java" as a reference to Java coffee. For this reason, the
    language's logo is a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Sun Microsystems released Java 1.0 in 1996. After that, new versions were released every 1
    to 3 years. Since Java 9, released in 2017, new versions have been released every 6 months. You can read more about
    its history and find the most recent version

<h4>Some important features of Java</h4>
<p>As we've mentioned before, the most important feature of Java is
    <strong>platform independence</strong>.
</p>
<p>Another important feature is a
    <strong>simple</strong> and
    <strong>clear syntax</strong>. Many elements of the language are easy to read and are widely used in other
    programming languages such as C/C++, C#, JavaScript, and Go.
</p>
<p>If you have ever written programs in C/C++, you know that manual memory cleaning can lead to bugs in the code.
    Fortunately, Java has a
    <strong>garbage collector</strong> that
    <strong>automatically cleans memory</strong> from unused objects during runtime.
</p>
<p>It is also important to note that Java supports multiple programming paradigms; you will get to know more about them
    in future topics. Java is primarily an imperative language based on the object-oriented concept: almost every part
    of a program is an object. Therefore, a program itself can be considered as a set of interacting objects. Also, it
    partially supports modern programming paradigms such as
    <em>generic programming, concurrent programming, functional programming</em>, and some others.
</p>


<p>In conclusion, Java is a modern and popular programming language that can be successfully used in almost all
    domains.</p>
