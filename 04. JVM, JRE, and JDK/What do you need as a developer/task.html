<h2>What do you need as a developer</h2>
<p>Imagine you want to write a Java program.</p>


<p>First, you will write a source code file with the 
  <code>.java</code> extension. Then you will compile it to obtain a
  <code>.class</code> file. Finally, you want to run the program.
</p>


<p>What is the minimal environment required to perform all of these actions?</p>
