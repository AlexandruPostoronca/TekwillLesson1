<h2>Overview of the basic program</h2>
<h4>The Hello World program</h4>
<p>Here is the Java code of this program:</p>
<pre><code>public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
} </code></pre>
<p>You can type this code in the <strong>Your Code</strong> section
    <a href="https://www.jdoodle.com/online-java-compiler" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>
    and then press the <strong>execute</strong> button. In the <strong>result</strong> section, you will see:</p>
<code>Hello, World!</code>
<p>If you have already installed Java, you can run the program on your computer. If not, there is no need to install it
    right now. We will do that later.</p>

<h4>The basic terminology</h4>
<p>Now that you have seen<strong> </strong>the result, let's learn some basic terminology and then try to understand
    this program.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Program</strong> – a sequence of instructions (called statements), which are executed one after another
        in a predictable manner. Sequential flow is the most common and straightforward sequence of statements, in which
        statements are executed in the order that they are written – from top to bottom in a sequential manner;
    </li>
    <li><strong>Statement</strong> – a single action (like print a text) terminated by semi-colon (<code>;</code>);</li>
    <li><strong>Block</strong> – a group of zero, one or more statements enclosed by a pair of braces <code>{...}</code>;
        There are two such blocks in the program above.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Method </strong>– a sequence of statements that represents a high-level operation (also known as
        subprogram or procedure).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Syntax</strong> – a set of rules that define how a program needs to be written in order to be valid;
        Java has its own specific syntax that we will learn;
    </li>
    <li><strong>Keyword</strong> – a word that has a special meaning in the programming language (<code>public</code>,
        <code>class</code>, and many others). These words cannot be used as variable names for your own program;
    </li>
    <li><strong>Identifier or name </strong>– a word that refers to something in a program (such as a variable or a
        function name);
    </li>
    <li><strong>Comment</strong> – a textual explanation of what the code does. Java comments start with <code>//</code>.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Whitespace</strong> –<strong> </strong>all characters that are not visible (space, tab, newline, etc.).
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>The Hello World program under a microscope</h4>

<p>The <strong>Hello World</strong> program illustrates the basic elements of Java programs. For now, we will
    discuss only the most important elements.</p>
<p>1. <strong>The public class.</strong> It is the basic unit of a program. Every Java program must have at least
    one class. The definition of a class consists of the <code>class</code> keyword followed by the class name. A class
    can have any name, such as <code>App</code>, <code>Main</code>, or <code>Program</code>, but it must not start with
    a digit. A set of braces <code>{...}</code> encloses the body of a class.</p>
<pre><code>public class Main {
    // ...
}</code>
</pre>
<p>The text after <code>//</code> is just a comment, not a part of the program. We will learn about comments in detail
    in later topics.</p>
<p><strong>2. The main method.</strong> To make the program runnable, we put a method named <code>main</code> inside a
    class. It is the entry point for a Java program. Again, the braces <code>{...}</code> enclose the body of the
    method, which contains programming statements.</p>
<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
    // statements go here
}</code>
</pre>
<p>The keywords <code>public</code>, <code>static</code>, and <code
>void</code> will be discussed later, so just remember them for now. The name of this
    method (<code>main</code>) is predefined and should always be the same. Capitalization
    matters; if you name your first method like <strong>Main</strong>, <strong>MAIN</strong> or something else, the
    program cannot start.</p>
<p>The element <code>String[] args</code> represents a sequence of arguments passed to the
    program from the outside world. Don't worry about them right now.</p>
<p><strong>3. Printing "Hello, world!"</strong>. The body of the method consists of programming statements that
    determine what the program should do after starting. Our program prints the string <strong>"Hello,
        World!"</strong> using the following statement:</p>
<code>System.out.println("Hello, World!"); // each statement has to end with;</code>

<p>This is one of the most important things to understand from the <strong>Hello World</strong> program. We invoke a
    special method <code>println</code> to display a string followed by a new line on the screen. We will often use this
    approach to print something of interest to the screen. The text is printed without double quotes.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">It is important that <strong>"Hello, World!"</strong> is not a keyword or an
    identifier; it is just a text to be printed.
</div>


<h4>Keywords</h4>
<p>As you can see, even a simple Java program consists of many elements, including <strong>keywords</strong> that are
    parts of the language. In total, Java provides more than 50 keywords which you will gradually learn on this
    platform. The full list is
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_keywords" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>,
    though you don't need to remember all of them at this moment.</p>

<div class="alert alert-primary">Note, <code>main</code> is outside the given list because it is not a keyword.</div>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>We have discussed the simplest program you can write in Java. It has a single class with a single <code>main</code>
    method. Every Java program must have a <code>main</code> method as it is the first to be executed when the program
    runs.<strong> </strong>Don't worry about memorizing every single term used in the topic (syntax, statement, block).
    These terms will reappear in further materials. Do not forget to use the provided <strong>Hello World</strong>
    program as a template for your own programs.</p>
